    question: "What is CrowdTest used for?",
    answer: "CrowdTest lets you get real human feedback on your web apps before launch. Testers report bugs, UX issues, and usability problems that automation tools often miss."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to pay to start testing?",
    answer: "No! You can sign up for a free account, submit your app link, and receive initial bug reports from our community of testers."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I submit multiple projects?",
    answer: "Yes, you can submit as many projects as you want. Each project gets its own dedicated feedback and bug reports from testers, all visible in your dashboard."
  },
  {
    question: "How will I know when a bug is reported?",
    answer: "You’ll get an email notification each time a tester reports a bug. You can also view all reported issues directly in your project dashboard."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my app or data safe with testers?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Only invited testers can access your project links, and we take privacy seriously to ensure your data remains secure."
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly will I get feedback?",
    answer: "Testers typically provide feedback within hours or a few days depending on the complexity of your project, so you can iterate quickly."
