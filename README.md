## 🚧 Join the Waitlist!

Catch bugs before your users do! If you're building a new app, let real developers test it before you go live. Boost your confidence in your app’s performance and reliability by joining our waitlist at [Crowdtest](https://crowdtest.dev).

Stay ahead of the game and ensure your application is ready for the world!


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project, expertly bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). Get ready to build something amazing!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Kick off your development journey by running the server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see your creation come to life!

### ✏️ Start Editing

Dive into the code by modifying `app/page.tsx`. Watch as your changes instantly reflect in the browser, making development a breeze!

## 🎨 Font Optimization

This project leverages [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to seamlessly optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a sleek font family designed for Vercel.
